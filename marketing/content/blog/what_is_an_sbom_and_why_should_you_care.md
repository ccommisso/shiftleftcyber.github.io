Software today isn't built from scratch - it is assembled from open-source components, third-party libraries,
and proprietary code. But do you really know what's inside the software you use or ship? 🔍💻

That's where a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) comes in. 📝

An SBOM is like an ingredient list for software, showing all the components that make up an application.
This transparency is crucial for:

🔐 Security - Quickly identifying vulnerabilities in software dependencies
✅ Compliance - Meeting regulatory requirements
⚠️ Risk Management - Understanding the supply chain to prevent hidden risks

While having an SBOM is a great start, it still isn't enough. The real challenge is securing it and
ensuring it can be trusted. 🔒🔑

Is your organization using SBOMs? What challenges have you faced? Let’s discuss! 💬👇
